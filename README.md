# PlantCare

This was back in March 2025
This project is for our Grade 12 Capstone Project in collaboration of 12 STEM C and 12 ICT B

PlantCare system focuses on building a smart plant watering system that uses hardware and software for efficient plant care. It includes a custom-built reservoir, pump system, and PVC piping to distribute water. An Arduino and ESP32 handle sensor data and control the pump, while a mobile app provides real-time monitoring via Bluetooth.
